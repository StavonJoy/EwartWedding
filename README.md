# Ewart Wedding App
## Unit 2 Project for General Assembly SEI

For my unit 2 project at GA I wanted to create a web app for my upcoming wedding. This web app will give my guests a site to view information about the bride and groom, details for the wedding, sign an online guest book, and view our registry information.

-------------------------------

### Wireframes / ERD

Here are the views of what the app will look like:

![about](../Wedding-App/public/images/about.png)
![info](../Wedding-App/public/images/info.png)
![guestbook](../Wedding-App/public/images/guestbook.png)
![registry](../Wedding-App/public/images/registry.png)
![ERD](../Wedding-App/public/images/erd.jpeg)

-------------------------------

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Google OAuth

-------------------------------

### Future Enhancements

I'd like to offer an updated page for the big party we're having after the pandemic for all the guests we couldn't invite to this event.
I'd also like to have the weather on the info page once it's closer to the wedding.
A spotify page for the playlist.
